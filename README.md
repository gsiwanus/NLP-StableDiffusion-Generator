# NLP-StableDiffusion-Generator
Using PyTorch Transformers (T5 - Text-to-Text Transfer Transformers) and GROQ  API, I developed an abstractive text summarization NLP to analyze medical research papers, conducted with community clinical trials, and identify key points by summarizing content from the abstracts, including results, methodologies, and conclusions. An image generation app was created leveraging Stable Diffusionâ€™s RunwayML v1-5 model and Python TKinter to develop infographics and pictographs for accessible back-reporting to community members.
