# NLP-StableDiffusion-Generator
Using PyTorch Transformers (T5 - Text-to-Text Transfer Transformers) and GROQ  API, I developed a NLP to summarize medical research papers, conducted with community clinical trials, to an 8th grade reading level and identify key points from the abstracts, including results, methodologies, and conclusions.  An image generation app was created leveraging Stable Diffusionâ€™s RunwayML v1-5 model and Python TKinter to develop infographics and pictographs for accessible back-reporting to community members.
